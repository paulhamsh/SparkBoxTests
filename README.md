# SparkBoxTests
Test version of SparkBox (https://github.com/happyhappysundays/SparkBox)    
And of SparkBoxW (https://github.com/copych/SparkBoxW)

Changed loads in my code (see Spark Changes).   

Changed the sw pins and also active low and changed CHRG_AIN to 35  (33 is one of my pins)   

Added long press on button 4 to restart the ESP - needed because it crashed so often. Could be dangerous but good for debugging.   

Working a lot better now with SparkBoxW3 - just Cosy Serenade preset seems to fail in the ui update code.
